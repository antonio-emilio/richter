A Open Source project of an autonomous/controlled robot using ESP32.

### Motivation
In february 2021, NASA launched Perseverance on the surface of Mars to kept looking for signs of past life on the red planet. 
This gave me chills and made me want to delevop some type of an autonomous/controlled robot for home/industrial use, using ESP32.
The idea is to develop an open source solution and make possible to people all around the world to contribuite to an idea.
