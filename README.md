# Richter
Richter is an autonomous/controlled robot. Oh, and of course. open source.

### Motivation
In february 2021, NASA launched Perseverance, on Mars surface to kept looking for signs of past life on the red planet. 
This gave me chills and made me want to delevop some type of an autonomous/controlled robot for home/industrial use, using ESP32.
The idea is to develop an open source solution and make possible to people all around the world to contribuite to an idea.
